This is a simulation of a mobile service robot that uses the [CoppeliaSim robotics simulator](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/)  to track and follow a person while maintaining a safe distance. The simulation is written in Lua and is included in the `.ttt` scene file.
## Requirements
- CoppeliaSim robotics simulator
## Running the Simulation 
1. Download and install the [CoppeliaSim robotics simulator](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/) . 
2. Clone or download this repository and extract the files to a directory. 
3. Open the `mobile service robot.ttt` file in CoppeliaSim. 
4. Click the "play" button in the CoppeliaSim simulator to start the simulation. 
5. The robot will start tracking and following the person. You can view the robot's camera feed and its movements in the CoppeliaSim simulator.
## Customization

You can customize the simulation by modifying the code in the `.ttt` scene file. The Lua code is included in the file and can be edited using the built-in script editor in CoppeliaSim.
## To-Do
- Port the Lua code over to Python and ROS.
